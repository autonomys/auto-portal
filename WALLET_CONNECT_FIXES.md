# Wallet Connection State Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Race Conditions in Auto-Reconnection
**Problem:** Multiple simultaneous connection attempts could occur during initialization.
**Fix:** Added `isInitializing` state and proper guards to prevent concurrent operations.

### 2. State Inconsistency 
**Problem:** Persisted `isConnected` state could be out of sync with actual wallet status.
**Fix:** Removed `isConnected` from persisted state, relying on active connection verification.

### 3. Missing Connection Timeout
**Problem:** Connection attempts could hang indefinitely.
**Fix:** Added configurable timeout (30s) with proper cleanup.

### 4. Silent Failure Handling
**Problem:** Auto-reconnection failures were completely silent, leaving users confused.
**Fix:** Added proper logging and state updates for failed reconnection attempts.

### 5. Error State Management
**Problem:** Connection errors weren't properly cleared or handled in all scenarios.
**Fix:** Improved error handling with specific timeout and authorization error detection.

## Implementation Details

### New State Properties
- `isInitializing: boolean` - Tracks wallet reconnection during app startup
- `lastConnectionAttempt: number | null` - Tracks timing of connection attempts

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Connection timeout detection with user-friendly messages
- Authorization error detection with retry functionality
- Better error state cleanup

### UI Improvements
- Loading states now distinguish between "Connecting" and "Reconnecting"
- Better user feedback during wallet operations
- Disabled states during initialization to prevent conflicts

### Persistence Strategy
- Only persist wallet selection and account preference
- Don't persist connection state to avoid inconsistencies
- Auto-reconnection attempts with proper error recovery

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability:** No more stuck connection states
2. **Better UX:** Clear feedback during all connection phases
3. **Proper Error Recovery:** Users can easily retry failed connections
4. **Consistent State:** UI always reflects actual wallet status
5. **Race Condition Prevention:** Multiple operations can't interfere with each other

## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test auto-reconnection by refreshing the page
2. Test connection timeout by delaying wallet authorization
3. Test multiple rapid connection attempts
4. Test wallet disconnection and reconnection flows
5. Test error states and recovery options
