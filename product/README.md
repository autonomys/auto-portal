# Staking Product Development

This directory contains all product development artifacts for the Autonomys staking application. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that enables operators and nominators to seamlessly stake on Autonomys domains.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

### Vision

Enable operators and nominators to seamlessly stake on Autonomys domains with a friction-less, transparent experience that matches or exceeds Web2 financial apps.

### Success Metrics

- **Time-to-first-stake**: < 5 minutes from landing to submitted transaction
- **Transaction failure rate**: < 1% (30-day rolling window)
- **User satisfaction (SUS)**: ≥ 80 for operators and nominators at GA
- **Staked supply**: ≥ 30% of circulating tokens within 6 months
