# ✅ Feature: Staking Form UI Mockup - COMPLETE

**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Frontend UI Implementation  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 📋 Summary

Create a staking form UI that displays the complete staking workflow with transaction preview, validation, and visual feedback. This was implemented as a **mockup** to validate UX and design patterns before real blockchain integration.

**Current State:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Full staking form UI implemented with mock data  
**Next Phase:** 🎯 [Auto SDK Integration](./auto-sdk-integration.md) - Replace mock data with real blockchain data

## 👤 User Story

> **As a** token holder who has selected an operator  
> **I want to** see a realistic staking interface with transaction preview  
> **So that** I can understand the staking flow and provide UX validation

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Components Created**

```
src/components/staking/
├── StakingForm.tsx          # Main form component
├── AmountInput.tsx          # Amount input with validation
├── TransactionPreview.tsx   # Fee breakdown display
├── OperatorSummary.tsx      # Operator info display
└── index.ts                 # Exports
```

### **Design Patterns Used**

- **Controlled form inputs** with proper validation
- **Zustand state management** for form state
- **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling

## 🚀 Handoff to Next Phase

### **Ready for Integration**

The staking form UI is **complete** and ready for [Auto SDK Integration](./auto-sdk-integration.md):

- ✅ **Form structure** established and validated
- ✅ **State management** patterns defined
- ✅ **Component architecture** ready for real data
- ✅ **UX patterns** validated and approved

### **Integration Points**

The Auto SDK integration can now:

1. **Replace mock balance** with real `balance()` calls
2. **Replace mock operators** with real `operator()` calls
3. **Replace mock transactions** with real `nominateOperator()` calls
4. **Maintain existing UI/UX** while adding real blockchain functionality
