# 📊 Feature: Nominator Position Integration ✅ COMPLETED

**Priority:** High
**Type:** Backend Integration + Portfolio Display
**Prerequisites:** ✅ Wallet connection system, ✅ Auto SDK integration
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Merged and Production Ready
**Implementation Date:** June 25, 2025
**Pull Request:** [#19](https://github.com/jfrank-summit/auto-portal/pull/19)

## 📋 Summary

✅ **COMPLETED:** Integrated user's current staking positions across operators using Auto SDK's `nominatorPosition()` function to display real portfolio data, pending operations, and position analytics.

**Previous State:**

- Dashboard showed mock portfolio data
- No visibility into user's actual staking positions
- No pending operations tracking

**✅ Current State (Implemented):**

- Real position data from RPC via `nominatorPosition()` calls
- Portfolio summary with total value and active positions count
- Detailed positions table with operator-specific data
- Pending deposits/withdrawals with timing information
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds to keep data current

## 👤 User Story

> **As a** connected wallet user who has staked tokens
> **I want to** see my current positions across all operators with real-time values
> **So that** I can track my portfolio performance and manage pending operations

**✅ User Story: COMPLETED and VERIFIED**

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria - ALL COMPLETED

### **✅ Position Data Integration**

- ✅ **Fetched user positions** across target operators (0, 3) via `nominatorPosition()` calls
- ✅ **Displayed position values** calculated from shares × current share price
- ✅ **Showed operator details** for each position (name, domain, status)
- ✅ **Handled empty positions** gracefully (no stakes with operator)
- ✅ **Position auto-refreshed** every 30 seconds

### **✅ Portfolio Analytics**

- ✅ **Calculated total portfolio value** from all positions
- ✅ **Counted active positions** (operators with stakes > 0)
- ✅ **Displayed position status indicators** (active, pending, withdrawing)
- ✅ **Displayed storage fee deposits** per position
- ✅ **Created portfolio summary cards** in dashboard

### **✅ Pending Operations Display**

- ✅ **Displayed pending deposits** with effective epoch timing
- ✅ **Displayed pending withdrawals** with unlock block information
- ✅ **Created visual indicators** for pending states
- ✅ **Counted pending operations** in portfolio summary

### **✅ Error Handling & UX**

- ✅ **Implemented loading states** during position fetching
- ✅ **Handled error states** for network failures
- ✅ **Designed empty state** when no positions exist
- ✅ **Handled partial data** when some operators fail
- ✅ **Implemented retry mechanisms** for failed position calls

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation - COMPLETED

### **✅ Components Created**

```
✅ apps/web/src/components/positions/
├── ActivePositionsTable.tsx   # Detailed positions table
├── PendingOperations.tsx      # Pending deposits/withdrawals
├── PositionSummary.tsx        # Portfolio overview cards
└── index.ts                   # Exports

✅ apps/web/src/services/
└── position-service.ts        # RPC position fetching

✅ apps/web/src/hooks/
└── use-positions.ts           # Position fetching with auto-refresh

✅ apps/web/src/types/
└── position.ts                # Position type definitions
```

### **✅ Files Modified**

```
✅ apps/web/src/pages/StakingPage.tsx                  # Dashboard integration
✅ apps/web/src/stores/wallet-store.ts                 # Centralized address formatting
```

### **✅ Dependencies Used**

```bash
✅ @autonomys/auto-consensus  # For nominatorPosition() calls
✅ @autonomys/auto-utils      # For RPC connection
```

## 🔧 Implementation Highlights

### **✅ 1. Position Service (Core RPC Integration)**

```typescript
// ✅ Fetches position data for multiple operators in parallel
const positionPromises = TARGET_OPERATORS.map(async operatorId => {
  // ... Promise.all to get position and operator data concurrently
});

// ✅ Calculates portfolio summary from fetched positions
export const calculatePortfolioSummary = (positions: UserPosition[]): PortfolioSummary => {
  // ... reduce functions to sum total value, fees, and pending operations
};
```

### **✅ 2. Position Hook with Auto-refresh**

```typescript
// ✅ Centralized hook to manage state, loading, errors, and auto-refresh
export const usePositions = (refreshInterval = 30000) => {
  // ... useEffect for initial fetch and setInterval for refresh
};
```

### **✅ 3. Smart UI based on Position Status**

```typescript
// ✅ Conditionally renders different components based on whether the user has positions
{hasPositions ? (
  <>
    <PositionSummary />
    <ActivePositionsTable />
    <PendingOperations />
  </>
) : (
  <OperatorGrid /> // Show operator grid if no positions exist
)}
```
