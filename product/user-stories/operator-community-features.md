# 👥 Feature: Operator Community Features

**Priority:** Low  
**Type:** Frontend + Backend + Community Integration  
**Prerequisites:** ✅ Basic Operator Details, ✅ User Authentication System  
**Status:** 🔮 **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT**

---

## 📋 Summary

Implement community-driven features that allow nominators to share experiences, rate operators, and provide insights to help other users make informed staking decisions. This creates a collaborative ecosystem around operator evaluation.

**Current State:**

- Operator evaluation relies solely on quantitative metrics
- No community feedback or shared experiences
- Users cannot benefit from collective knowledge of other nominators

**Target State:**

- Operator ratings and review system
- Community insights and shared experiences
- Nominator reputation and trusted reviewer system
- Social proof for operator selection decisions

---

## 👤 User Story

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Plan

### **1. Community Data Models**

```typescript
// Community-related types
interface OperatorReview {
  id: string;
  operatorId: string;
  reviewerId: string;
  rating: {
    overall: number; // 1-5 stars
    reliability: number; // 1-5 stars
    communication: number; // 1-5 stars
    performance: number; // 1-5 stars
  };
  content: {
    title: string;
    review: string;
    pros: string[];
    cons: string[];
    recommendation: 'highly_recommend' | 'recommend' | 'neutral' | 'not_recommend';
  };
  metadata: {
    stakeAmount: string;
    stakeDuration: number; // days
    isVerified: boolean;
    isAnonymous: boolean;
  };
  engagement: {
    helpfulVotes: number;
    totalVotes: number;
    replies: number;
  };
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface NominatorProfile {
  id: string;
  address: string;
  publicName?: string;
  isAnonymous: boolean;
  reputation: {
    score: number;
    totalReviews: number;
    helpfulReviews: number;

  };
  badges: CommunityBadge[];
  preferences: {
    publicProfile: boolean;
    emailNotifications: boolean;
    communityAlerts: boolean;
  };
}
```

### **2. Community Components**

```typescript
// src/components/community/

```

### **3. Community Service Layer**

```typescript
// src/services/community-service.ts
export class CommunityService {
  async submitReview(review: Omit<OperatorReview, 'id' | 'timestamp'>): Promise<void> {
    // Validate user has minimum stake with operator
    // Submit review with spam prevention
    // Update operator aggregate ratings
  }

  async getOperatorReviews(operatorId: string, filters: ReviewFilters): Promise<OperatorReview[]> {
    // Fetch reviews with filtering and sorting

  }

  async voteOnReview(reviewId: string, isHelpful: boolean): Promise<void> {
    // Record helpfulness vote
    // Update reviewer reputation

    // Automatic moderation for obvious spam
    // Community moderation queue
  }
}
```

### **4. Enhanced Operator Details Integration**

```typescript
// Enhanced operator details page with community features
export const OperatorDetailsPage = () => {
  // ... existing operator details logic

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-6">
      {/* Existing sections */}
      <OperatorDetailsHeader operator={operator} />
      <OperatorPoolStats operator={operator} />

      {/* New community section */}
      <CommunityInsightsSection operatorId={operatorId} />
      <OperatorReviewsSection operatorId={operatorId} />

      <OperatorActions operator={operator} />
    </div>
